\section*{Game Overview}

\subsection*{Introduction}

Eldritch Escape is a sidescrolling platformer where players play as Andy, the ace of his school's dodgeball team. Kidnapped by his school's biggest rival-Lovecraft High-right before the big game and stashed inside the basement of their school, the player must guide Andy through weirdness and insanity to escape Lovecraft High and make it back home in time for the game.

The game takes place just before Andy's school is set to take on Lovecraft High in the biggest dodgeball game of the year. Lovecraft High's team-The Horrors-decide to kidnap Andy to force  his team to forfeit, and tie him up in the basement of their school. The player must navigate a surreal school full of platforming elements, eldritch enemies, and traps to progress.

\subsection*{Design Goals}

The aim of Eldritch Escape is to provide a fun platforming experience that combines the comisc horror of the Lovecraftian vein of fiction with a lighthearted setting of a school to achieve a black comedy feel. The horror elements should double as both an indication of the threat to the player, as well as a source of comedic relief that the setting is treated as something normal. By layering these thematic elements on top of a fast-paced platformer we aim to create a memorable experience.

\section*{Game World}

\subsection*{Overview}

Andy is the ace of his local high school's dodgeball team. Their biggest rival has always been Lovecraft High, the elite school that only admits direct relatives of Cosmic Deities. Lovecraft high will do practically anything to get an edge over anyone that dares challenge their superiority. In the past they've broken into rival schools, stolen game-time equipment, driven coaches to frothing insanity... the usual things hyped up kids will do.

\subsection*{Game Location}

The game itself will take place inside Lovecraft High. Andy escapes his bonds after being kidnapped and begins in the basement of the school. The front door isn't so much locked as it is a portal to another dimension, so that won't work. The player must navigate Andy through different sections of the school-the basement, the science lab, the cafeteria, etc.-in order to find a way out back into his home dimension.

\subsection*{Travel}

The player moves through the game world in a 2D space by moving left or right, and jumping. The school is one large interconnected level populated by the students of Lovecraft High as well as objects like pushable boxes.

\subsection*{Characters}

\begin{itemize}
\item Andy
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Ace of his school's dodgeball team. Kind and confident. Still gets picked on at school by the football players.
	\end{itemize}

\item Sandra
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Andy's girlfriend. Manager of the cheerleading club. Normally soft-spoken and nerdy, but incredibly forceful and loud when agitated.
	\end{itemize}

\item Kl'gnyth
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Captain of Lovecraft High's dodgeball team. Arrogant and incomprehensible. Kl'gnyth has a fierce personal rivalry with Andy, believing him to be the biggest threat to his dominance of both high school and the mortal world.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Level Design}

Because Lovecraft High is a school for the relatives of cosmic deities-beings of unfathomable will and power-the school itself is no ordinary high school. The halls and classrooms are infested with eldritch horrors from other dimensions. Tentacles and eyes grow out of the walls; mad whispers echo in the hallways; girl students pierce their ears and dye their hair and none of the teachers say anything. The atmosphere is dark with a log of purple, dark red and bright green coloring.
