\section*{Game Overview}

\subsection*{Introduction}

Eldritch Escape is a sidescrolling platformer where players play as Andy, the ace of his school's dodgeball team. Kidnapped by his school's biggest rival-Lovecraft High-right before the big game and stashed inside the basement of their school, the player must guide Andy through weirdness and insanity to escape Lovecraft High and make it back home in time for the game.

The game takes place just before Andy's school is set to take on Lovecraft High in the biggest dodgeball game of the year. Lovecraft High's team-The Horrors-decide to kidnap Andy to force  his team to forfeit, and tie him up in the basement of their school. The player must navigate a surreal school full of platforming elements, eldritch enemies, and traps to progress.

\subsection*{Targets}

Eldritch Escape is targeted towards players age 12+ who enjoy the "Metroidvania" experience. The game is targeted to launch on PC.

\subsection*{Design Goals}

The aim of Eldritch Escape is to provide a fun platforming experience that combines the comisc horror of the Lovecraftian vein of fiction with a lighthearted setting of a school to achieve a black comedy feel. The horror elements should double as both an indication of the threat to the player, as well as a source of comedic relief that the setting is treated as something normal. By layering these thematic elements on top of a fast-paced platformer we aim to create a memorable experience.

\section*{Competitive Analysis}

\subsection*{Comparison - Metroid & Castlevania}

Metroid is looked at as such a classic game that it created it's own genre along with 'Castlevania'. Now, any game utilizing a large, interconnected level that is initially locked off but opens up more as the player character progresses and gains more abilities is referred to as a "Metroidvania style" game. However this doesn't mean there is no room for innovation. For one, it's been four years since a Castlevania game in this style has been released, and over 10 for Metroid. These are two intensely beloved series both for their satisfying gameplay and lore-rich worlds. By using the gameplay of these series as a base to build on, and introducting a world already rich in lore and possibilities, Eldritch Escape can duplicate and even surpass these titles.

\subsection*{Comparison - Super Meat Boy}

Super Meat Boy is an indie 2D platformer focused almost entirely on the diffculty level of its platforming. Levels are designed to be short snippets that take a very short time to navigate, with the goal being to complete each level as quickly as possible. There are also secrets scattered about different levels for players to find. Super Meat Boy balances out these short levels by providing a punishing level of difficulty, resulting in most levels requiring multiple tries to complete. Because Eldritch Escape is not solely a platformer game and includes elements of combat and puzzle solving, it will never be possible to responsibly make it as fast-paced as Super Meat Boy. However elements of its level design can still be used as inspiration for sections of Eldritch Escape. Many levels of the game require strictly timed and choreographed sequences of jumps, so that decisions made at the beginning of a level often have an effect on your ability to finish the level later on, as a poorly timed setup jump can leave the player in a position that makes the subsequent jump much more difficult. Utilizing Eldritch Escapes' inclusion of combat and, eventually, power-ups, we can provide an experience that utilizes this idea of sequence platforming (as opposed to each action being separate with separate consequences) to provide an harsh initial challenge to the player that becomes easier as they progress through the game. This allows the player to revisit earlier areas without having to conquer the same high challenge as before, and gives a sense of increasing power.


\section*{Game World}

\subsection*{Overview}

Andy is the ace of his local high school's dodgeball team. Their biggest rival has always been Lovecraft High, the elite school that only admits direct relatives of Cosmic Deities. Lovecraft high will do practically anything to get an edge over anyone that dares challenge their superiority. In the past they've broken into rival schools, stolen game-time equipment, driven coaches to frothing insanity... the usual things hyped up kids will do.

\subsection*{Game Location}

The game itself will take place inside Lovecraft High. Andy escapes his bonds after being kidnapped and begins in the basement of the school. The front door isn't so much locked as it is a portal to another dimension, so that won't work. The player must navigate Andy through different sections of the school-the basement, the science lab, the cafeteria, etc.-in order to find a way out back into his home dimension.

\subsection*{Travel}

The player moves through the game world in a 2D space by moving left or right, and jumping. The school is one large interconnected level populated by the students of Lovecraft High as well as objects like pushable boxes.

\subsection*{Characters}

\begin{itemize}
\item Andy
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Ace of his school's dodgeball team. Kind and confident. Still gets picked on at school by the football players.
	\end{itemize}

\item Sandra
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Andy's girlfriend. Manager of the cheerleading club. Normally soft-spoken and nerdy, but incredibly forceful and loud when agitated.
	\end{itemize}

\item Kl'gnyth
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Captain of Lovecraft High's dodgeball team. Arrogant and incomprehensible. Kl'gnyth has a fierce personal rivalry with Andy, believing him to be the biggest threat to his dominance of both high school and the mortal world.
	\end{itemize}

\item Soggoth
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Andy's only ally inside Lovecraft High. Offers suggestions and tips from afar. Sarcastic and non-serious personality. Absolutely hates Kl'gnyth sa he believes he's stifling the chaotic freedom once enjoyed at the school in favor of tyrannical order.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Level Design}

Because Lovecraft High is a school for the relatives of cosmic deities-beings of unfathomable will and power-the school itself is no ordinary high school. The halls and classrooms are infested with eldritch horrors from other dimensions. Tentacles and eyes grow out of the walls; mad whispers echo in the hallways; girl students pierce their ears and dye their hair and none of the teachers say anything. The atmosphere is dark with a log of purple, dark red and bright green coloring.

\subsection*{Basement}

The basement level serves as the first area of the game, doubling as a short tutorial. Players awaken in a room after being tied up, having already broken free from their bonds. The game quickly displays the controls to move left and right. After exiting this first room, the player is confronted with a crate. The game then displays the control for jump. After jumping up some inclining steps, the payer is confronted with their first enemy. This enemy is basic and acts as little more than practice for the player. The game then displays the "attack" control and how it works. The player defeats this enemy and moves forward. Here, the player is confronted with their first crate pushing puzzle, along with two enemies. At this point, they are contacted telepathically by Soggoth. After an introduction, Soggoth explains that the player is stuck in the basement and will have to escape past Kl'gnyth's mindslaved student followers. He suggests that you utilize objects around you to climb out, but warns that the student enemies will not let you push crates past them without doing something to stop you. The player solves this puzzle by eliminating the enemies and then pushing both sets of crates to the leftmost wall.

After climbing these crates, the player is presented with a more difficult puzzle to clear the level. The player must find a way to stack 4 boxes on top of each other so that they can reach the ledge above. After solving this puzzle, the player advances by defeating a few more enemies on their way to the ladder that leads them out of the basement and onto the next level.

\subsection*{1st Floor Halls}

Players emerge into the first floor of the school proper. This is where things start to get a little weird aesthetics-wise. While the halls look mostly like a normal school, the layout seems awkward and impossible. Floating platforms dot the halls, and seemingly random rises and falls in the terrain provide platforming challenge for the player. The player must make their way through the level avoiding tentacle pits(functionally spike pits), defeating more active enemies, and solving item and platforming puzzles to progress. The objective for the player is to find the key that opens up the way to the Lecture Hall.
